# CNN-Implementation

It is a work in progress..

I am implementing a Convlutional Neural Netweork from scratch. 
The user can decide on the layers in the network and the number of neurons in each layer.
The aim is to build a configurable neural network.

The end goal of the project is to investigate the effects of number of (neurons in a layer/number of layers) versus accuracy and time complexity.

I aim to finish the project by Jan 30, 2020.
